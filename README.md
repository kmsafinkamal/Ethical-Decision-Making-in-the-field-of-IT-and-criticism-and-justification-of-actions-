: Let’s assume, Alice was a young software engineer with a bright future ahead of her. She was talented, 
hardworking, and passionate about her work. She had recently been promoted to lead a team of engineers for her 
company. The company wanted to monitor employees’ progress and productivity of each day. So, the project was to 
develop a software that would allow the company to track their employees' productivity. Then, one of the higher 
authorities proposed to develop a new type of AI software that would monitor the employees all the time and company 
accepted the idea. Afterwards, Company assigned Alice for the project. Alice was excited about the project, but she 
soon realized that there was an ethical dilemma involved. The software that Alice was developing would be able to 
track employees' every move. It would record how long they spent on each task, how many times they took breaks, and 
even how many times they went to the bathroom. This level of surveillance would give the company a huge amount of 
power over their employees. It is true that this will increase productivity of the company, but using AI to monitor the 
humans is not fair. Alice knows that some the company would use this power to exploit their employees. They might 
use the software to pressure employees to work longer hours, or to fire employees who were not meeting their 
productivity goals. Alice was worried that the software would create a hostile work environment and make it difficult 
for employees to have a work-life balance. In this case, Alice is so confused and she has to make a choice.
